Hi Sanjay, I have approached this way to contact you. I am sorry. 

This is shashank, I looked for an Indian guy who contributed their code to the cloud foundry. So that i can learn from your contribution to CF

I would like to gain knowledge from you about cloud foundry. 

Would it be possible for you to allocate some of your time for a tech talk.

You can reach out to me inusasunny@gmail.com.

Its kind of wierd and funny approaching this way but have to do it anyway. Bye :) Thanks
